This script replicates key findings from the work of Nigel G. Stocks on suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) and the enhancement of information transmission through networks of noisy threshold elements. It simulates a summing junction network with Gaussian input and additive noise and compares empirical mutual information with theoretical predictions. The relevent paper is in the same folder.
