# Public_Repo
Code allowed for public viewing.

This repository contains selected code excerpts related to ongoing research in  machine learning noise benefits and noise-driven computation, inspired in part by the work of my supervisor Nigel G. Stocks. Due to patenting and publication processes currently underway, the code presented here is intentionally limited in scope and context. As such, certain components may appear isolated or abstract, and are not intended to fully demonstrate the integrated system. The included snippets are representative of a small amount of methods or ideas, but not their full implementation or application.
